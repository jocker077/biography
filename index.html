            It was four-o’clock in the afternoon of <strong>July 8, 2001, </strong>a baby Boy was born and named after his great-grandfather.<sup>1</sup> His name is <i>Angelito</i>, He was born in <em>Kabacan, North Cotabato</em>, a place where <b>Christians</b> and <b>Muslims</b> peacefully lived.<sup>2</sup>.At a very young age, Angelito already knows that the Man who married his Mother was not his biological father.<sup>3</sup>. He already understands that his father didn’t showed himself to own his obligations when he impregnates my Mother at a very young age of 18.<sup>4</sup>At first, my grandma was very mad to the point that he asks my Mother to abort me while it’s not too late, because she needs to finish her <em>studies</em> first.<sup>5</sup>As we all know in the past, that a teenage pregnancy is a <i>disgrace</i> to the family and to the people around that being pregnant in an early age is a very big issue.<sup>6</sup>My Mother didn’t agree with my Grandma about the abortion, that’s why I am here alive, breathing and kicking.<sup>7</sup> I understand how my Grandma feels about the pregnancy of my Mother, because my Mother is already at 3rd year College pursuing <b>Civil Engineering</b> and was the First born among <em>4 siblings</em>.<sup>8</sup>At the age of 3 I entered day care at our barangay, it was a happy feeling to go to school to learn new things and specially to have a new friend. <sup>9</sup> I thought that life is going well, I thought that life is all about being happy, just go to school and play with your friends then go home eat and sleep. <sup>10</sup>Not until I noticed problems, I noticed everything change, everyday my grandparents are stressed-out because of my Grandma’s brother who envy’s our family very much.<sup>10</sup>We used to have a good life, we used to have a car, our family used to have enough money for everyday but it all ended because of envy.<sup>11</sup>. My grandma’s Brother disparage my Grandpa towards his Boss who eventually lost his trust towards my Grandpa and accused of stealing money behind his back. <sup>12</sup>Because of misunderstandings and having a toxic relative we left my home town, the place where I was born, the place where I have my Friends, the place where I used to live. <sup>13</sup>We left Kabacan, North Cotabato when I was 5 and moved out to Trento, Agusan Del Sur.<sup>14</sup>At first it was very hard to adjust because we had a different dialect, we used to speak <i>Ilocano</i> and the people lived in Agusan was speaking <i>Bisaya</i> or <i>Cebuano</i>. <sup>15</sup>In our first week I was very afraid to go out because I don’t understand and don’t speak their dialects, and specially I don’t know anyone yet.<sup>16</sup>After a month or two we finally learned and slightly understands Bisaya, so my Mother decided to enroll me in kindergarten. <sup>17</sup>I was very afraid at first because they might dislike me because of where I came from, yes! Racism exist even if you’re from the same nation.<sup>18</sup>But luckily, I found friends whom I can play with and learns to speak their dialect fluently.<sup>19</sup> I though being new to place you don't know is a bad thing, but I learned new things through new people.<sup>20</sup>

        <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Years passed by, I already graduated in Elementary and now dealing with my early <b>adolescence</b>. 12 years of age and yet I don’t know what path to take or what course should I pursue in my college.<sup>1</sup> When I was In Grade 6, I was belonged to a <i>Special Science Class</i>, a higher section than the regular classes that’s why automatically I belong in a Higher section when entering High School.<sup>2</sup><i>Special Program in Journalism</i> or <b>SPJ</b> is the section where I belong.<sup>3</sup>Unlike other section we are much more advance in <em>English</em> subject and have 1 extra subject which is <em>Journalism</em> and we starts our class at 5:00 am up to nearly 6:00 pm.<sup>4</sup>They said that high School life is the best part of the students, and I disagree.<sup>5</sup>When I was in section <b>SPJ</b> I cannot enjoy studying because of responsibility as a higher section and a part of the <i>supreme student government</i>.<sup>6</sup>In every event that we had in school we cannot partake in any type of activity because we need to create news article to present to our adviser at the end of the day. <sup>7</sup> Stressing our selves everyday I almost give up, I lost my interest in School, I lost interest in my life.<sup>8</sup>Fortunately, I met my best friend and he helped me to enjoy life, he also told me to change section but unfortunately the principal asks me to give 100 reasons why I want to change my section and I can’t even name 10 of them. <sup>9</sup>Even though I have a tighter schedule in school, my best friend and I always finds way to have a leisure time sometime we cut classes just to go to a computer shop to release stress and have a good day. <sup>10</sup>Fast forward, we’re already at grade 9 I lost contact to my Best friend, weeks and weeks he didn’t go to school until one day I heard that his mother died and he stopped because he needs to take care of his siblings while his father is working.<sup>11</sup> I started again to feel helpless and almost got drop because I don’t want to go to the class. <sup>12</sup>I tend to cut classes and go to the bridge where I can think peacefully. <sup>13</sup>I’m not a showy person about emotion I just listen to music to refresh my mind, and ease the pain of overthinking about what my life would be if I always thinks of negative things<sup>14</sup>. I don’t want to go home, our house doesn’t feel like home I can only see them shouting at each other, fighting about something, there is no peace at all.<sup>15</sup>. I want to go far away from people at that moment, I want to start a new life, I want to look for my father and ask him about everything, and cursed and tell him that he is the reason that I’m living my life with a missing part.<sup>17</sup>What’s a child without a father? What is the feeling of having a complete and a happy family? What would I do to fulfill the missing part of my identity? I don’t know anymore. <sup>18</sup>Before the dawn, with a heavy heart I return home thinking and thinking about things that myself can not answer. <sup>19</sup>. Final years of my high school, I did all my best passed all my subjects and to be able to march on the stage and accept my diploma. But two days before graduation, my mother told me to come with him in <b>Manila</b> and study senior high there. Without a doubt I packed my things and joined my Mom to her flight going <b>Manila</b>.<sup>20</sup>

As the days goes by, we got closer and closer to each we even have a plan to have a leisure time every Friday. <sup>15</sup>I thought that we will graduate together, the ten of us but it all changed when one of my friend got a boyfriend and eventually stopped talking to us and keeps avoiding us giving as  conflicts towards them.<sup>16</sup>Fast forward when the pandemic broke out the world, forcing me to go home in <i>Agusan</i> and stopped for a year.<sup>17</sup>My friends continued to study, and I’m 1 year behind them now.<sup>18</sup>At first it was okay, we chit chat sometimes until no communication at all.<sup>19</sup>Till today, we barely asks each other regards, and almost forgot each other. But I believe that no matter what, they’re still my friends.<sup>20</sup>
